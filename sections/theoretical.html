    <h1>Theoretical Foundations</h1>
    <h2>Relationship to Evolutionary Biology</h2>
    <p>
      Genetic algorithms (GAs) mimic natural selection by simulating the
      evolutionary processes observed in nature, such as selection, crossover,
      and mutation, to solve optimization problems. Inspired by Charles Darwin's
      theory of natural selection, GAs start with a population of randomly
      generated individuals, each representing a potential solution encoded as
      chromosomes [1] [8]. These individuals are evaluated based on a fitness
      function that measures how well they solve the problem at hand [8]. The
      fittest individuals are selected to reproduce, ensuring that their
      desirable traits are passed on to the next generation through crossover,
      where segments of parent chromosomes are exchanged to create offspring
      with new combinations of traits [3] [10]. Mutation introduces random
      changes to some genes, maintaining genetic diversity and preventing
      premature convergence to suboptimal solutions [8] [9]. This iterative
      process of selection, crossover, and mutation continues over many
      generations, gradually improving the population's overall fitness and
      converging towards an optimal solution [4] [6]. Various selection methods,
      such as elitism, roulette wheel, tournament, and rank selection, are
      employed to ensure that the best individuals have a higher chance of
      reproducing [8]. Additionally, GAs can be enhanced with hybrid approaches
      and new rules for parent selection to improve their efficiency and
      effectiveness in solving complex problems [7]. Applications of GAs range
      from medical diagnoses and language identification to video game
      simulations and solving classical optimization problems like the Traveling
      Salesman Problem [1] [4] [5] [10]. By mimicking the principles of natural
      evolution, GAs provide a robust and adaptive method for finding
      high-quality solutions in large and complex search spaces [2] [9].

    <h2>Comparison with other optimization techniques</h2>
    <h3>Genetic-Algorithms vs Neural Networks</h3>
    <p>
      Genetic algorithms are search-based optimization algorithms used to find
      optimal or near-optimal solutions for search problems and optimization
      problems. Neural networks, on the other hand, are mathematical models that
      map between complex inputs and outputs. They can classify elements that
      are not previously known. Genetic algorithms usually perform well on
      discrete data, whereas neural networks usually perform efficiently on
      continuous data. Genetic algorithms can fetch new patterns, while neural
      networks use training data to classify a network.
