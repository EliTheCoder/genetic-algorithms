    <h1>Applications of Genetic Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Optimization problems</h2>
    <p>
      GAs excel at solving optimization problems, aiming to find the best
      solution among a large set of possibilities. These problems include
      mathematical function optimization, parameter tuning, portfolio
      optimization, resource allocation, and more. GAs explore the solution
      space by enabling the evolution of a population of candidate solutions
      using genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation,
      gradually converging towards an optimal or close-to-optimal solution
    </p>
    <h2>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      GAs have applications in machine learning, particularly to optimize the
      configuration and parameters of machine learning models. GAs can be used
      to optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization
      parameters, and network architectures in neural networks. They can also be
      employed for feature selection, where the algorithm evolves a population
      of feature subsets to identify the most relevant subset for a given task.
    </p>
    <h2>Engineering design</h2>
    <p>
      Genetic algorithms find application in many designing procedures of
      mechanical components. For instance, consider the following genetic
      algorithm example where the aircraft wing design is a kind of designing
      problem that takes multiple disciplines into consideration. It requires
      improvement in the ratio of left to drag for a complex wing. The fitness
      function in genetic optimization is flexible to considerations that come
      as a demand for a particular design.
    </p>
    <h2>Financial modeling</h2>
    <p>
      A variety of issues can be solved using genetic optimization in the
      financial market. It helps in finding an optimal combination of parameters
      that can affect the trades or market rules. You can also find out the
      near-optimal value for the optimal set of parameters.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration with other AI techniques</h2>
    <p>
      Genetic programming in machine learning finds great applications for
      neural networks in machine learning. We use it for â€Œgenetic optimization
      in neural networks or use cases like inheriting qualities of neurons,
      neural network pipeline optimization, finding the best fit set of
      parameters for a given neural network, and others.
