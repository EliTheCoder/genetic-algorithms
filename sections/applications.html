    <h1>Applications of Genetic Algorithms</h1>
    <h2>Optimization problems</h2>
    <p>
        GAs excel at solving optimization problems, aiming to find the best
        solution among a large set of possibilities. These problems include
        mathematical function optimization, parameter tuning, portfolio
        optimization, resource allocation, and more. GAs explore the solution
        space by enabling the evolution of a population of candidate solutions
        using genetic operators such as selection, crossover, and mutation,
        gradually converging towards an optimal or close-to-optimal solution
    </p>
    <h2>Machine learning and artificial intelligence</h2>
    <p>
        GAs have applications in machine learning, particularly to optimize the
        configuration and parameters of machine learning models. GAs can be used
        to optimize hyperparameters, such as learning rate, regularization
        parameters, and network architectures in neural networks. They can also be
        employed for feature selection, where the algorithm evolves a population
        of feature subsets to identify the most relevant subset for a given task.
    </p>
    <h2>Engineering design</h2>
    <p>
        Genetic algorithms find application in many designing procedures of
        mechanical components. For instance, consider the following genetic
        algorithm example where the aircraft wing design is a kind of designing
        problem that takes multiple disciplines into consideration. It requires
        improvement in the ratio of left to drag for a complex wing. The fitness
        function in genetic optimization is flexible to considerations that come
        as a demand for a particular design.
    </p>
    <h2>Financial modeling</h2>
    <p>
        A variety of issues can be solved using genetic optimization in the
        financial market. It helps in finding an optimal combination of parameters
        that can affect the trades or market rules. You can also find out the
        near-optimal value for the optimal set of parameters.
    </p>
    <h2>Integration with other AI techniques</h2>
    <p>
        Genetic programming in machine learning finds great applications for
        neural networks in machine learning. We use it for â€Œgenetic optimization
        in neural networks or use cases like inheriting qualities of neurons,
        neural network pipeline optimization, finding the best fit set of
        parameters for a given neural network, and others.
