        <li>
            <h3>Population</h3>
            <p>
                Population is a subset of solutions in the current generation. It can also be defined as a set of
                chromosomes. There are several things to be kept in mind when dealing with GA population. The diversity
                of the population should be maintained otherwise it might lead to premature convergence. The population
                size should not be kept very large as it can cause a GA to slow down, while a smaller population might
                not be enough for a good mating pool. Therefore, an optimal population size needs to be decided by trial
                and error.

            <h3>Fitness function</h3>
            <p>
                The fitness function is the function that the GA tries to maximize. The word "fitness" is taken from
                evolutionary theory. It is used here because the fitness function tests and quantifies how 'fit' each
                potential solution is. The fitness function is one of the most pivotal parts of the algorithm because it
                defines the goal that the model progresses towards.

        </li>

            <h3>Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Selection is the stage of a genetic algorithm in which individual genomes are chosen from a population
                for later breeding. Essentially, you choose which candidates will live to the next generation and
                reproduce. There are different selection algorithms you can use for selection. Retaining the best
                individuals in a generation unchanged in the next generation, is called elitism or elitist selection. It
                is a successful variant of the general process of constructing a new population
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Crossover</h3>
            <p>In genetic algorithms and evolutionary computation, crossover, also called recombination, is a genetic
                operator used to combine the genetic information of two parents to generate new offspring. It is one way
                to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population, and is analogous to the crossover
                that happens during sexual reproduction in biology. Solutions can also be generated by cloning an
                existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions may be mutated
                before being added to the population.

                Mutation is a genetic operator used to maintain genetic diversity of the chromosomes of a population of
                a genetic or, more generally, an evolutionary algorithm (EA). It is analogous to biological mutation.

            <h3>Mutation</h3>
            <p>The classic example of a mutation operator of a binary coded genetic algorithm (GA) involves a
                probability that an arbitrary bit in a genetic sequence will be flipped from its original state. A
                common method of implementing the mutation operator involves generating a random variable for each bit
                in a sequence. This random variable tells whether or not a particular bit will be flipped. This mutation
                procedure, based on the biological point mutation, is called single point mutation. Other types of
                mutation operators are commonly used for representations other than binary, such as floating-point
                encodings or representations for combinatorial problems.
