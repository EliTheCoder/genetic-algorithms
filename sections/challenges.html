    <h1>Challenges and Limitations</h1>
    <h2>Computational complexity</h2>
    <p>
        GAs can be computationally expensive, especially for large-scale problems.
        This is because they require a large number of fitness evaluations, which
        can be computationally intensive. This makes GAs less suitable for
        problems where computational resources are limited.
    </p>
    <h2>Premature convergence</h2>
    <p>
        Another significant limitation is premature convergence. This is when the
        algorithm converges on a sub-optimal solution too early, before it has had
        a chance to explore other potentially better solutions. This can happen if
        the population of solutions becomes too similar to each other, which
        reduces the diversity of the population and limits the search space. This
        is a particular problem in GAs because they use a fitness-based selection
        process, which can lead to the over-representation of certain solutions in
        the population
    </p>
    <h2>Parameter tuning</h2>
    <p>
        GAs also require careful parameter tuning. The performance of a GA can be
        greatly affected by the choice of parameters, such as the population size,
        mutation rate, and crossover rate. However, there is no one-size-fits-all
        set of parameters that works best for all problems. Therefore, finding the
        right parameters can be a time-consuming process that requires a lot of
        trial and error.
