    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
        We have attempted to present in a condensed way the different properties
        of genetic algorithms, their merits as exploration and optimisation
        heuristics, and the challenges they face, notably in computation
        efficiency, parameter configuration, realism and robustness. We hope to
        have well covered the search space in this objective and to have
        identified its most promising points of its landscape. Genetic algorithms
        are particularly suitable to solving sparse problems in large, rugged
        search spaces. They require very few assumptions on the fitness landscape
        properties, deal well with existence of local optima, or multiplicity of
        extrema. They are applicable to a wide range of problems, and are quite
        efficient in returning good solutions quickly. They have achieved
        particular performance in the evolution of neural networks,
        multi-objective optimisation and genetic programming. They are more than
        optimisers, as they generate novelty, are directly connected to artificial
        life as they foster emergence of complex digital ecologies, and a clear
        relation with open-ended evolution that can greatly improve the modelling
        of evolutionary, adaptive systems. Genetic algorithms have been facing
        significant issues in computation efficiency and cost, and in parameter
        configuration. The latest developments of genetic algorithms towards
        meta-learning architectures, learning how to learn, and the endogenous
        generation of learning environments, have placed AI-generating algorithms
        as a credible means to produce general AI (Clune, 2019). Open-endedness in
        their evolution could lead them to produce interesting and increasingly
        complex discoveries, and so indefinitely (Stanley et al., 2019).
