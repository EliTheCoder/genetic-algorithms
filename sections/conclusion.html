    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>
      We have attempted to present in a condensed way the different properties
      of genetic algorithms, their merits as exploration and optimisation
      heuristics, and the challenges they face, notably in computation
      efficiency, parameter configuration, realism and robustness. We hope to
      have well covered the search space in this objective and to have
      identified its most promising points of its landscape. Genetic algorithms
      are particularly suitable to solving sparse problems in large, rugged
      search spaces. They require very few assumptions on the fitness landscape
      properties, deal well with existence of local optima, or multiplicity of
      extrema. They are applicable to a wide range of problems, and are quite
      efficient in returning good solutions quickly. They have achieved
      particular performance in the evolution of neural networks,
      multi-objective optimisation and genetic programming. They are more than
      optimisers, as they generate novelty, are directly connected to artificial
      life as they foster emergence of complex digital ecologies, and a clear
      relation with open-ended evolution that can greatly improve the modelling
      of evolutionary, adaptive systems. Genetic algorithms have been facing
      significant issues in computation efficiency and cost, and in parameter
      configuration. The latest developments of genetic algorithms towards
      meta-learning architectures, learning how to learn, and the endogenous
      generation of learning environments, have placed AI-generating algorithms
      as a credible means to produce general AI (Clune, 2019). Open-endedness in
      their evolution could lead them to produce interesting and increasingly
      complex discoveries, and so indefinitely (Stanley et al., 2019).
