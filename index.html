    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>
        Genetic algorithms are a method for solving both constrained and unconstrained optimization problems that is
        based on natural selection,
        the process that drives biological evolution. The genetic algorithm repeatedly modifies a population of
        individual solutions. At each
        step, the genetic algorithm selects individuals from the current population to be parents and uses them to
        produce the children for the
        next generation. Over successive generations, the population "evolves" toward an optimal solution.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        Genetic algorithms were first introduced by John Holland in the 1960s, marking a significant advancement in the
        field of evolutionary computation and artificial intelligence. Over the years, these algorithms have evolved and
        found widespread applications in diverse domains, ranging from engineering and finance to bioinformatics and
        robotics.
        Origin and History of the Term Genetic Algorithm
        The term genetic algorithm originated from the pioneering work of John Holland, who developed these algorithms
        while exploring computational models of adaptation and evolution. Initially, genetic algorithms were formulated
        to simulate processes of natural selection and genetics, laying the foundation for their application in solving
        complex optimization problems.
        Evolution of Genetic Algorithm
        Since their inception, genetic algorithms have undergone continuous refinement and adaptation, leading to the
        development of more sophisticated variants and hybrid approaches. The evolution of genetic algorithms has been
        marked by advancements in genetic operations, selection strategies, and their integration with other AI
        techniques, resulting in their widespread adoption across various industries.
        The ST5 X-band antenna was designed thanks to a genetic algorithm. This type of antenna is best for a certain
        radiation pattern and is much more efficient than standard antennas (for instance, helical antenna), partly
        because of its asymmetrical shape.
